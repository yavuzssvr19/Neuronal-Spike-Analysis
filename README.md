# Neuronal Spike Analysis
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for simulating neuronal activity using the Linear Integrate-and-Fire model. It includes tools for analyzing spike times and neuronal firing patterns, ideal for computational neuroscience research and education.

## Features
- **Simulation of Neuronal Spiking:** Using the LIF model to simulate the firing behavior of neurons under various input conditions.
- **Interactive Analysis:** Leveraging `ipywidgets` for interactive parameter manipulation to explore different neuronal dynamics.
- **Data Visualization:** Custom plotting functions to visualize spike times, interspike intervals, and histograms of firing patterns.
