# Neuronal Spike Analysis
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for simulating neuronal activity using the Linear Integrate-and-Fire model. It includes tools for analyzing spike times and neuronal firing patterns, ideal for computational neuroscience research and education.

## Features
- **Simulation of Neuronal Spiking:** Using the LIF model to simulate the firing behavior of neurons under various input conditions.
- **Interactive Analysis:** Leveraging `ipywidgets` for interactive parameter manipulation to explore different neuronal dynamics.
- **Data Visualization:** Custom plotting functions to visualize spike times, interspike intervals, and histograms of firing patterns.

## Code Overview
- **Spike Time Analysis:** Calculate and plot spike times for single and multiple neurons to explore neuronal firing patterns.
- **ISI Histograms:** Generate histograms to visualize the distribution of inter-spike intervals, helping to understand the temporal dynamics of neuronal spiking.
- **Neuronal Simulation with Adjustable Parameters:** Interactive sliders allow real-time adjustments of parameters like the spike rate and membrane potential, illustrating their impact on neuron behavior.
- **Comparison of Different Functional Fits:** Analyze how different mathematical functions (exponential, inverse, linear) fit the ISI data, aiding in hypothesis testing about underlying neuronal mechanisms.
